Explore these intriguing Questions that will take you on a journey through statistical analysis and hypothesis testing! 📊💡 Here's what you'll find:

### Question 1: Probability and Normal Distribution 📈📊

#### 1a) Probability of Negative Returns

Simulate a portfolio's annual returns using a normal distribution and calculate the probability of negative returns. Visualize the distribution and calculate the probability.

#### 1b) Top Percentile Returns

Determine the cutoff for the highest 15% of annual returns and visualize this percentile in the distribution.

### Question 2: Hypothesis Testing 🧪🔬

#### 2a) Testing a Reward System

Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if a new reward system was effective in reducing absenteeism. Calculate the test statistic, p-value, and interpret the results.

#### 2b) Power Analysis

Estimate the probability of missing a significant reduction in absenteeism with the new reward system and calculate the beta (Type II error) value.

#### 2c) Sample Size Calculation

Calculate the required sample size for a study to achieve a power of 95% in detecting the effect of the new reward system.

### Question 3: Chi-Squared Test 📉📊

#### 3a) Expected Values

Calculate the expected values for a chi-squared test of independence using given probabilities and observed data.

#### 3b) Chi-Squared Test

Conduct a chi-squared test of independence with observed and expected values. Calculate the test statistic, critical value, and interpret the results.
